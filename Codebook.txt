Introduction 
The scrip run_analysis.R has the 5 steps required on the project description. 
1. Download the data and read it into Rstudio. Then combine the test and train data set using rbind() & cbind() function. 
2. Only columns with mean and standard deviation are taken from the whole dataset. Use the grep() function and then gsub() to take away the ().
3. Use the activity names and ID from activity_label.txt to substitute the whole dataset, as activities value are given by 1 to 6.
4. Label the dataset with descriptive variables. 
5. Create a new data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Variables
1. trset,trlabel,trsubject,teset,telabel,tesubject contains the data downloaded from the dataset. 
2. set,label,subject contain the merged set, label and subject data.
3. features contain the correct names for the ÒsetÓ dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in keepcolumn, a numeric vector.
4. activity contain the correct names for the label dataset, which are applied to the numeric vector label.
5. merge merges set,label,subject in to a big dataset.
6. averge_data contains the average of subject and activity stored in tidy_data.txt. Use the ddply()  from plyr packages to apply colmeans().
