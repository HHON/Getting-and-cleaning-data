Introduction The scrip run_analysis.R has the 5 steps required on the project description. 1. Download the data and read it into Rstudio. Then combine the test and train data set using rbind() & cbind() function. 2. Only columns with mean and standard deviation are taken from the whole dataset. Use the grep() function and then gsub() to take away the “()”.3. Use the activity names and ID from activity_label.txt to substitute the whole dataset, as activities value are given by 1 to 6.4. Label the dataset with descriptive variables. 5. Create a new data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.Variables1. “trset”,”trlabel”,”trsubject”,”teset”,”telabel”,”tesubject” contains the data downloaded from the dataset. 2. “set”,”label”,”subject” contain the merged set, label and subject data.3. “features” contain the correct names for the “set” dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in “keepcolumn”, a numeric vector.4. “activity” contain the correct names for the “label” dataset, which are applied to the numeric vector “ label”.5. “merge” merges “set”,”label”,”subject” in to a big dataset.6. “averge_data” contains the average of “subject” and “activity” stored in “tidy_data.txt”. Use the ddply()  from “plyr” packages to apply colmeans().
